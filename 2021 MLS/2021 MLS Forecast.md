*What's "SIWI"?* : The "**S**hould **I** **W**atch **I**t?" rating is a measure of how interesting a game could be depending on both how evenly matched the two teams are and how good they are compared to the rest of the leauge. A high SIWI indicates two strong teams are facing off while a low SIWI indicates two weak teams, or a good team and a weak team are clashing.
